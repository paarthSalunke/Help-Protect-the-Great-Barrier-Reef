Problem Statement - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef

Australia's stunningly beautiful Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and home to 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of corals, 130 species of sharks, rays, and a massive variety of other sea life. Unfortunately, the reef is under threat, in part because of the overpopulation of one particular starfish - the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (or COTS for short).The outbreak of the COTS is one of the greatest threats to the great barrier reef , together We need to take action because if you don't…. then the great barrier reef won't be so great!

With the help of scientist tourism operators and Queensland University of technology is developing a robot that can identify and inject COTS autonomously. We need to develop object detection model which can identify COTS in live video footage so the robot can identify COTS inject white vinegar inside COTS

Up to 2021 great barrier reef foundation manually counts COTS within range in GBFR to analyze outbreak of COTS which is not accurate , with help of object detection model and Underwater video footage , thousands of reef images and the AI technology could drastically improved efficiency and scale at which the reef manages detect and control COTS outbreaks.
Our work will help researchers identify species that are threatening Australia's Great Barrier Reef and take well-informed action to protect the reef for future generations.
